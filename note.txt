Every time the database is modified it is necessary to generate a database migration. 
In Chapter 4 I showed you how to set up the application to track database changes through migration scripts. 
Now I have two new fields that I want to add to the database, so the first step is to generate the migration script:

$ flask db migrate -m "new fields in user model"
$ flask db upgrade
